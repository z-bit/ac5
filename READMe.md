AngularClass webpack-starter, based on rc.5

* [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter.git)
* [original README](doc/README.md)
* suggested material2 branch was not up to date
* so this one starts out with regular starter
* **remove /doc folder from .gitignore**  
* [add Material 2](doc/addMaterial.md)
* [create MaterialModule to be added to each Module, instead of adding every single Md...Module](doc/addMaterialModule.md)
* add Material Directives: route via Toolbars in ***app.component.ts***, this uses class="fill-space" which is defined in ***app.styles.css*** as
    **span.fill-space {
        flex: 1 1 auto;
    }**
* **todo** Each new layer of Sub-Modules takes header space: **sidenav** as top navigation.
